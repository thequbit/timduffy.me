          Ballots are notorious for being difficult to understand.  If this is your
          first time voting, hopefully this small description will help you.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are four different positions that are going to be filled this 
          election day.  Those four positions are:
        </p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem;">
          <li>State Supreme Court Justice, 7th Judicial District</li>
          <li>Family Court Judge</li>
          <li>Sheriff</li>
          <li>Town Supervisor</li>
          <li>(2) Members of Town Council</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          There are 7 different political parties represented on our ballot.  Click the
          links below to get brought to the parties website or facebook page.
        </p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li><a href="http://monroedemocrats.com/">Democratic</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.monroegop.com/">Republican</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://mccp.us/">Conservative</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://workingfamilies.org/">Working Families</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Monroe-County-Independence-Party-191379297559003/">Independence</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://reformpartyny.org/">Reform</a></li>
          <li>Bright Future ( no website available )</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When filling our the ballot, you should only have one mark per vertical
          column, since a column represents a single office being filled.  In the
          case of Town Supervisor, there are three unique names that will be 
          on the ballot:
        </p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 5rem">
          <li>Stephen L Schultz ( Democratic and Working Families )</li>
          <li>Jack W Moore ( Republican, Conservative, Independence, and Reform )</li>
          <li>Jeffery P Kueppers ( Bright Future )</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You may only vote for a single supervisor, so you would bubble-in a
          single name in the Supervisor column.  You may, however, pick which
          party you'd like to show support for when voting for said candidate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you were going to vote for Schultz, you could do so in one of two
          places: Democratic or Working Families.  If you were going to vote for
          Moore, then you have three options.  You have but one option for Kueppers.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of the Member of Town Council, you will be filling out the 
          two columns as a single large column where any two candidates can be
          selected.  That is, of the 5 possible options, you should have only 2
          bubbles filled in.
        </p>

          queens park should see this same ballot, however it is a good idea
          to check yourself.  You can do so here:
